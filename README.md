# BattleShip-Game
This is My Battleship Game in which there are different ships and you have to hit each ship with their co-ordinates.


Battleship is usually a two-player game, where each player has a fleet and an ocean
(hidden from the other player), and tries to be the first to sink the other player’s fleet.
We will do just a solo version, where the computer places the ships, and the human
attempts to sink them.

We’ll play this game on a 20x20 ocean. This is larger than the ocean in the traditional
battleship game. In this game we will have one 8-square Battleship, one 7-square
Battlecruiser, two 6-square Cruisers, two 5-square Light Cruisers, three 4-square
Destroyers and four 3-square Submarines. Finally, unlike the traditional game, A player
can shoot 5 times in each turn.


Enter the five co-ordinates (x,y) separated by ; to make hit.
